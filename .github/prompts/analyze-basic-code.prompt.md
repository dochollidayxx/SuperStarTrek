# BASIC to C# Analysis

I need to analyze a section of the original BASIC Super Star Trek code and create a C# implementation plan.

## Analysis Request

Please analyze the following BASIC code section and provide:

1. **Functionality Summary**: What does this code do in the game?
2. **Data Structures**: What variables and arrays are used?
3. **Control Flow**: How does the logic flow (GOTO, GOSUB, loops)?
4. **String Operations**: What string manipulations are performed?
5. **C# Design**: Recommended classes, methods, and patterns
6. **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step conversion approach

## BASIC Code Section

```basic
${selection}
```

## Context

This code is part of the Super Star Trek game migration project. The goal is to preserve exact gameplay behavior while modernizing the code structure.

Please reference the [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) document for architecture patterns and [MIGRATION.md](../MIGRATION.md) for conversion strategies.

## Expected Output

Provide a detailed analysis with:
- Clear explanation of the game mechanics
- Recommended C# class structure
- Conversion challenges and solutions
- Implementation priority and dependencies
