# Damage Control System Implementation - Phase 4.1 Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Damage Control System as the first component of Phase 4 (Ship Systems). This implementation provides authentic 1978 BASIC game behavior for ship system damage, repairs, and management.

## Completed Features

### 1. DamageControlCommand (DAM Command)
- **File**: `src/SuperStarTrek.Game/Commands/DamageControlCommand.cs`
- **BASIC Reference**: Lines 5680-5980
- **Features**:
  - Damage control system operational check
  - Starbase manual repair service with time cost calculation
  - Complete damage report display for all 8 ship systems
  - Proper time consumption handling via CommandResult
  - Authentic repair time calculation (0.1 stardates per damaged system + random factor)

### 2. Enterprise Automatic Repair System
- **File**: `src/SuperStarTrek.Game/Models/Enterprise.cs`
- **BASIC Reference**: Lines 2770-3030
- **Features**:
  - Automatic repairs during warp movement
  - Warp factor-based repair rates (higher warp = faster repairs)
  - Partial repair logic (systems between -0.1 and 0 damage set to -0.1)
  - Full repair completion reporting
  - Random system damage/improvement events (20% chance during movement)

### 3. Combat Damage Integration
- **File**: `src/SuperStarTrek.Game/Models/Enterprise.cs`
- **BASIC Reference**: Lines 6140-6170
- **Features**:
  - Hit strength threshold checking (minimum 20 units)
  - Probability-based damage occurrence (60% chance + damage ratio check)
  - Random system selection for damage
  - Damage calculation based on hit strength and shield levels

### 4. Ship System Management
- **File**: `src/SuperStarTrek.Game/Models/ShipSystem.cs` (Enhanced)
- **Features**:
  - 8 ship systems matching original BASIC (WarpEngines, Sensors, Phasers, etc.)
  - System display names matching original game text
  - System operational status tracking

## Test Coverage

### DamageControlCommandTests (8 tests)
- Damage control system inoperable scenarios
- Repair service offerings when docked
- Manual repair acceptance/rejection
- Damage report formatting
- Help text validation

### AutomaticRepairSystemTests (11 tests)
- Automatic repair rate calculations
- Partial repair boundary conditions
- Random damage/improvement events
- Combat damage application
- System damage tracking

**Total New Tests**: 19 comprehensive tests
**All Tests Passing**: 114/114 (100% success rate)

## Authentic BASIC Behavior Preserved

### Damage Control Logic
1. **Inoperable Check**: `IF D(6)<0 THEN "DAMAGE CONTROL REPORT NOT AVAILABLE"`
2. **Repair Time Calculation**: Each damaged system adds 0.1 stardates + random factor
3. **Repair Time Cap**: Maximum 0.9 stardates per BASIC line 5780
4. **Starbase Repairs**: Complete system restoration when docked and authorized

### Automatic Repair Logic
1. **Repair Rate**: `D6=W1:IF W1>=1 THEN D6=1` (warp factor based)
2. **Partial Repair**: `IF D(I)>-.1 AND D(I)<0 THEN D(I)=-.1` 
3. **Completion Reporting**: Damage control reports when systems fully repaired
4. **Random Events**: 20% chance of system damage/improvement during movement

### Combat Damage Logic
1. **Hit Threshold**: `IF H<20 THEN 6200` (skip damage for weak hits)
2. **Probability Check**: `IF RND(1)>.6 OR H/S<=.02 THEN 6200`
3. **Damage Formula**: `D(R1)=D(R1)-H/S-.5*RND(1)`
4. **Random System**: Uses FNR(1) function for system selection

## Integration Points

### Command Factory
- DAM command registered and available
- Proper random number generator injection
- Help text integration

### GameState Integration
- Time advancement handled via CommandResult.TimeConsumed
- No direct gameState modification by commands (proper separation)
- Compatible with existing game loop architecture

### Enterprise Model
- Damage tracking via Dictionary<ShipSystem, double>
- Operational status checking for all game systems
- Repair message generation for display

## Code Quality Standards Met
