## Migration Strategy Details

### BASIC to C# Conversion Patterns

#### Variable Mapping
```basic
' BASIC Arrays
DIM G(8,8)     -> int[,] galaxy = new int[8,8]
DIM K(3,3)     -> KlingonShip[] klingons = new KlingonShip[3]
DIM D(8)       -> ShipSystem[] systems = new ShipSystem[8]
```

#### Control Flow Conversion
```basic
' BASIC GOTO/GOSUB
1990 GOTO 2060  -> Structured control flow
GOSUB 6430      -> Method calls
```

#### String Operations
```basic
' BASIC String Functions
LEFT$(A$,3)     -> string.Substring(0, 3)
MID$(A$,4,2)    -> string.Substring(3, 2)
RIGHT$(A$,5)    -> string.Substring(string.Length - 5)
```

### Quality Assurance

#### Behavioral Testing
- **Input/Output Comparison**: Verify identical behavior to original
- **Random Seed Testing**: Consistent results with same random seed
- **Edge Case Verification**: Boundary conditions and error handling
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Ensure acceptable performance

#### Code Quality
- **Static Analysis**: Code analysis tools and linting
- **Code Review**: Peer review of all significant changes
- **Refactoring**: Continuous improvement of code structure
- **Design Patterns**: Application of appropriate patterns

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Complexity**: Original BASIC code uses complex string manipulation
- **State Management**: Global state dependencies in original
- **Random Numbers**: Ensuring identical random behavior
- **Performance**: Modern expectations vs. original constraints

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Development**: Small, testable changes
